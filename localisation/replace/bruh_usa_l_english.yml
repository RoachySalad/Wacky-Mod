 #### FOCUSES ####
 USA_new_deal_2:0 "Second New Deal"
 USA_new_deal_2_desc:0 "Although the economy has begun to rise since the tragedy of 1929, there is more work to be done. Millions remain unemployed, and radicals have begun to criticize FDR for not going far enough. His answer to this was the Second New Deal, a bundle of policies aimed specifically at alleviating the damages done by the Depression."
 USA_construction_1:0 "Farm Security Administration"
 USA_construction_1_desc:0 "The successor to the Resettlement Administration, the FSA was a program designed to emphasize the challenges of rural poverty and worked to alleviate its effects through generous spending and purchase of land."
 USA_construction_2:0 "National Labour Relations Act"
 USA_construction_2_desc:0 "The NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act, is the foundation of American labor law and fully legalizes trade unions under the principle of collective bargaining. Aimed at bestowing power to workers in the fact of abject poverty, company unions and unfair labor practices are banned under this law."
 USA_construction_3:0 "Rural Electrification"
 USA_construction_3_desc:0 "Though we are and always have been a modern nation, large portions of the countryside lack basic utilities such as electricity and running water. The Rural Electrification Act aims to rectify this issue by installing electrical distribution systems throughout isolated rural areas."
 USA_construction_4:0 "Natural Resource Development"
 USA_construction_4_desc:0 "Though rich in natural resources, the economic crisis has left mineral extraction as a secondary concern. This is simply the incorrect approach. Economic revitalization requires employment and stimulus, both of which mineral extraction provides."
 USA_construction_5:0 "Social Security Act"
 USA_construction_5_desc:0 "The bank crash has left its mark upon the elderly of America above all others. An unprecedented amount of retirement funds have been lost to the market, leaving many without the means to live. To prevent a repeat of this issue, the Social Security Act will impose a tax upon all individuals earning income, which will then be issued to those in retirement. It is in this way we may save prior generations from bearing our errors."
 USA_landon_deal:0 "Landon's Deal"
 USA_landon_deal_desc:0 "One of the New Deal's most influential supporters is, ironically enough, Alf Landon himself. Criticizing some portions of the policies, he also supported many more instances of New Deal legislation. Landon's Deal will bring out what the New Deal is meant to be, without any of the dangerous radicalism Roosevelt included."
 USA_labour_management:0 "Labour-Management Relations Act"
 USA_labour_management_desc:0 "Labor unions wield unprecedented power in the workforce, though clearly not for the better. We must limit the unfair labor practices of unions and ensure the balance of power and order in corporate society."
 USA_business_ties:0 "Business Ties"
 USA_business_ties_desc:0 "Among Landon's chief supporters are large businesses, believing that FDR's policies were far too union-favored. Landon's election means prosperity for corporations, and we cannot let them forget that."
 USA_standard_oil:0 "Standard Oil of California"
 USA_standard_oil_desc:0 "Rarely does one see an oil baron as president, but that is exactly what has occurred. We cannot let this opportunity go to waste, for influence is useful, regardless of how it may be attained."
 USA_gold_standard:0 "Reaffirm the Gold Standard"
 USA_gold_standard_desc:0 "Fiat currency is far too volatile during recession. It is the duty of the government to regulate currency to the greatest efficacy plausible, and we have deemed it necessary for a stable backing of the dollar to be reinstated."
 USA_tackle_waste:0 "War on Waste"
 USA_tackle_waste_desc:0 "In times of trouble, the populace must be conscious of all usage, no matter how small. The American people are industrious, it should be no trouble to reduce waste in the short-term."
 USA_denounce_neutrality:0 "Denounce Neutrality"
 USA_denounce_neutrality_desc:0 "The United States of America has always stood as the defender of liberty, regardless of borders or affiliation. We cannot discard this notion simply because of a recession. The American people will fight on!"
 USA_tax_reform:0 "Tax Reform"
 USA_tax_reform_desc:0 "The income tax has been a disaster in the long run, and has far outlived its purpose. Siphoning much-needed revenue from household families is simply immoral. By reinstituting certain tariffs and excise taxes, we can lower the tax rates on individuals."
 USA_the_sherman:0 "The Sherman"
 USA_the_sherman_desc:0 "The M4 Sherman has proven itself to be a very capable and versatile vehicle. Our production efforts should be focused on improving the quality and quantity of it's manufacturing process."
 USA_hello_to_ford:0 "Say Hello to Ford..."
 USA_hello_to_ford_desc:0 "The American automotive industry was by far the largest in world. We should use this massive car making industry to outfit our troops with modern fighting vehicles and transports."
 USA_douglas_c47:0 "Douglas C-47"
 USA_douglas_c47_desc:0 "The C-47 differed from the civilian DC-3 in numerous modifications, including being fitted with a cargo door, hoist attachment, and strengthened floor, along with a shortened tail cone for glider-towing shackles, and an astrodome in the cabin roof."
 USA_race_for_rubber:0 "Race for Rubber"
 USA_race_for_rubber_desc:0 "Production of synthetic rubber in the United States expanded greatly during World War II since the Axis powers controlled nearly all the world's limited supplies of natural rubber by mid-1942. By 1944, a total of 50 factories were manufacturing it, pouring out a volume of the material twice that of the world's natural rubber production before the beginning of the war."
 USA_victory_plan:0 "Implement The Victory Plan"
 USA_victory_plan_desc:0 "In 1941, a team of officers led by General Albert Wedemeyer on behalf of General George C. Marshall drew up the Victory Program, whose premise was that the Soviet Union would be defeated that year, and that to defeat Nazi Germany would require the United States to raise by the summer of 1943 a force of 215 divisions comprising 8.7 million men."
 USA_congress_campaign:0 "Combat Congressional Isolationism"
