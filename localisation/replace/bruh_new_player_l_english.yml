  newPlayer.1.t:0 "Combat Width and Templates"
  newPlayer.1.d:0 "TFB uses the older combat width system with multiples of 10, leading to good defending divisions being 20 width and good attacking divisions being 30 width (in general).\n\n Note that there are more support companies and unit types in TFB than in Vanilla, but a template of 8 infantry brigades, 2 artillery brigades, and 2 anti-tank brigades is a decent generic template for infantry. Some may choose 2 less artillery/at for an extra infantry brigade depending on their opponent."

  newPlayer.5.d:0 "If you are playing against an AI China, then China will spawn 3 different waves of conscript divisions.\n\nWave 1: 15% Surrender Progress and 500K casualties\nWave 2: 30% Surrender Progress and 1.25M casualties\nWave 3: 60% Surrender Progress OR 3.5M casualties\n\nIn order to best combat this as you push in China each attack should be done with the goal of killing divisions or taking supply hubs, and only at the very very end can you snake for VP's. Building Collaboration governments is important to completing China in a decent amount of time."

If you are struggling you have a decision which will give you a small stat boost against Finland after a certain amount of casualties.\n\nYour primary goal should be to not have any divisions encircled, as it is expected you will lose and you need to conserve strength for the Eastern Front.

  newPlayer.13.t:0 "France Paths"
  newPlayer.13.d:0 "France has 3 paths you can go down from left to right: Democratic, Socialist, Conservative. Going Left Left to 'Nationalize Key Industry' for the Democratic Path is Historical. Socialist path provides some extra industry in Africa for after capping but a weaker pre-cap. Conservative France provides a stronger France at the expense of a weaker Free-France, as you don't get to use the Industry tree on the left side."
