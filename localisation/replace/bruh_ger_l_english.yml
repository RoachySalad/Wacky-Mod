 GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "Interessengemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG, more sanely known as IG Farben, is a chemical and pharmecuticals company, as well as the largest company in Europe. With war on the horizon, their help would be better steered towards synthetics."
 GER_expand_mefo:0 "Expand MEFO"

 GER_rearm_fast:0 "Fast Rearmament Strategy"

 GER_rearm_fast3:0 "Consolidation of Production"
 GER_rearm_fast3_desc:0 "Collectivization on a macroeconomic scale may be difficult, but military industry is another story. By changing the classification of arms manufacturing to the public sector, we can afford a far more centralized military-industrial complex."
 GER_rearm_slow:0 "Long-term Rearmament"
 GER_rearm_slow_desc:0 "It is through economies of scale that we shall emerge victorious in the long-term. A perfect bliztkrieg may sound appealing, but in the event we must fight a war of attrition, we must be ready. The choice is clear."

 GER_steel_werke:0 "Herman Goring Werke"
 GER_steel_werke_desc:0 "Reichswerke Hermann Göring is one of many industrial conglomerates based in Germany with the sole task of managing ore mining and steel output. There's no time to waste; feed the machine."

 GER_reichsarbeit:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
 GER_reichsarbeit_desc:0 "The Great Depression has not left Germany unscathed, and many German men remain out of the job. Through establishing the Reich Labor Service, we can keep the economy healthy whilst guaranteeing a steady supply of labor."
 GER_military_rad:0 "Mobilise the RAD"

 GER_strategic_air_effort2_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine may not be up to the task of tackling America, but a bomber capable of traversing the vast Atlantic, delivering its payload, then making the return trip would certainly give us the edge in a war of attrition. We shall break the American Dream yet!"

 GER_artillery2:0 "Heavier Guns"
 GER_artillery2_desc:0 "Above and below, German guns bombard all that God created for the Fatherland. All that remains is the issue of calibre. Recent advances show that we might yet cram bigger bullets into these barrels."

 GER_improved_command_desc:0 "Our famous General Staff has served us well throughout these victories, though with new enemies lurking around each corner, the OKH must adapt."
 GER_bewegungskrieg:0 "Bewegungskrieg"
 GER_bewegungskrieg_desc:0 "Wars will not be decided by force of arms or firepower, but through battles of maneuver. The future of the blitzkrieg will be a mobile war."
 GER_panzer:0 "Panzer Effort"
 GER_panzer_desc:0 "The Panzer Corps is the ace up our sleeve. The Great War tought us many lessons, chief among them being the importance of tanks. We cannot allow this war to devolve into a bloody hell of trenches. Swiftness is key."
 GER_panzer2:0 "Advanced Medium Designs"
 GER_panzer2_desc:0 "Able to take on the roles of both a scout tank and mainline battle tank, Medium Panzer units shall prove themselves very effective in the coming battles."

 GER_avenge_versailles_desc:0 "Over these long few years, we have never once lost sight of our goal--the complete repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles. With the last vestiges of formal French resistance fleeing overseas, the time to declare our victory over the new Entente is nigh! The unequal treaty has been purged from the annals of history, never to reach the light again!"

 GER_west_research:0 "Western Knowledge"
 GER_west_research_desc:0 "Though initially we believed that nothing of intellectual value could be salvaged from these husks of nations, it would seem as though French research teams have taken German inspiration in several fields, and are thusly suitable for use."
 GER_italy_friend:0 "Pact of Steel"
 GER_italy_friend_desc:0 "The Italians, imperfect as they are, represent a key ally in the fight to come. Cast adrift on our own after the Great War, the Italians most importantly share our sense of bitterness towards the Entente."
